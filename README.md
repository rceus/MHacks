Anthem is a cross platform application that allows different mobile and computer devices to turn into a loudspeaker. You can access YouTube videos and the video can be streamed across these devices. The video across all platforms is synchronized completely to enable perfection of voice and video. 

We came up with this idea with an intention to promote synchronized play over all platforms to fulfill the need of external speakers. 

<b>How it works?</b>

It is a master - slave approach. There is one master who dictates what video has to be synchronized. There can be N number of slaves. These slaves follow the master. The script in the master continously sends the exact position being played in the video; and this data is picked up by the slaves to synchronize themselves.
